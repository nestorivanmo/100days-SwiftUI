# Drawing: second technique project

Dutch impressionist Vincent Van Gogh once said:

> I sometimes think there is nothing so delightful as drawing

## Introduction

In this project we are going to focus on drawing in SwiftUI, including creating custom paths and shapes, animating your changes, solving performance problems. SwiftUI uses the same drawing system that we have on the rest of Apple's frameworks: Core Animation and Metal. CoreAnimation is responsible for our drawing or UI elements such as TextField and when things get too complex we look for Metal - Apple's low level  framework that's optimized for drawing.
