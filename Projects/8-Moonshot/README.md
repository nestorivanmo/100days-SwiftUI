## Resizing images to fit the screen using GeometryReader

When we create an Image view in SwiftUI, it will automatically size itself according to the dimensions of its contents. We are going to use GeometryReader to make sure our image fills the full width of its container view. GeometryReader is a view, but when we create one we will have eto work with a GeometryProxy object which lets us query the environment.
